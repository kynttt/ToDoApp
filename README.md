## Description

This application serves as a comprehensive task management tool, offering the ability to efficiently organize and manage your tasks with various features and functionalities:

- Task Organization: Tasks can be structured with essential data, including titles, descriptions, dates, and the ability to mark them as complete or important.
- Categorization and Routes: Tasks are intelligently categorized into distinct routes for easy navigation. These routes include Today's tasks, Important tasks, Incomplete tasks, Complete tasks, All tasks, and tasks organized by directory (folder). Users have the flexibility to edit or delete both directories and individual tasks. Notably, there exists a central directory labeled "Main," which is immutable and cannot be altered or removed.
- Sorting and Viewing: You have the freedom to customize how your tasks are displayed. Choose to view your task list by criteria such as nearest deadline, farthest deadline, completeness, or incompleteness. This ensures that you can tailor your view to your specific needs.
- Search Functionality: A robust search feature enables you to effortlessly locate any task in your list, making it easy to find and access specific items.
- User-Centric: Today's tasks are prominently featured in the user section and notifications, ensuring that you stay updated on your immediate to-dos.
- Data Persistence: Your tasks, directories, and dark mode preferences are all securely saved to localStorage, providing a seamless and consistent user experience.
